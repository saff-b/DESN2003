Options for housing

1) get a spherical object and use that as a mount
- rigid spheres are difficult to get ahold of in the size needed
- if someone is willing to drop a couple hundred on this project this is possible, otherwise no

2) 3D print one per orb maker
- orb maker will generate an hollow orb with 
- generated orb will have to be split to be printed, printing process means this method would have very little options for failure

3) laser cut a frame
- could use this process https://www.ponoko.com/blog/how-to-make/creating-laser-cut-3d-forms-super-easily/
- could also custom design one (with a bit of maths) 
- benefits: very fast, acrylic is (comparatively) cheap, can be done in clear acrylic if we really want a clear one
- downsides: will not be completely solid
- could even do one like this https://www.instructables.com/Laser-Cut-Living-Hinge-Globe-Light/ 

Options for countries
1) 3d print curved outlines
- generate outlines of countries and form to the curve of our globe
- will take a while to print all the countries but relatively hands off approach and has the potential to be accurate

2) laser cut country outlines in segments
- fast
- easy
- will be difficult to align to the sphere - maybe heat forming?

3) handmade wire forming
- slowest option 
- i will not be able to do this (as I have arthritis so it would be someone else's job)

4) making a skin (fabric)
- using textiles, make a skin which fits over the globe
- this would hide the skeleton
- lights could shine through the skin, or small holes could be cut
- potential for some very pretty effects
- high effort
